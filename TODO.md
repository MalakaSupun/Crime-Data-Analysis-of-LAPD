## Step 1: Understand the Data

### Preview the Data
Query a few rows to confirm everything is correctly loaded:
```sql
SELECT * FROM CrimeData LIMIT 10;
```

### Examine Columns and Data Types
```sql
DESCRIBE CrimeData;
```

### Check for Missing Data
```sql
SELECT COLUMN_NAME, COUNT(*), COUNT(COLUMN_NAME) 
FROM CrimeData
GROUP BY COLUMN_NAME;
```

## Step 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with SQL

### 2.1. Temporal Analysis

#### Crimes by Month
```sql
SELECT MONTH(DateOcc) AS Month, COUNT(*) AS CrimeCount
FROM CrimeData
GROUP BY Month
ORDER BY Month;
```

#### Crimes by Hour
```sql
SELECT HOUR(TimeOcc) AS Hour, COUNT(*) AS CrimeCount
FROM CrimeData
GROUP BY Hour
ORDER BY Hour;
```

### 2.2. Spatial Analysis

#### Top Areas by Crime Count
```sql
SELECT AreaName, COUNT(*) AS CrimeCount
FROM CrimeData
GROUP BY AreaName
ORDER BY CrimeCount DESC;
```

### 2.3. Weather-Crime Relationships

#### Crimes on Rainy Days
```sql
SELECT CrmCdDesc, COUNT(*) AS CrimeCount
FROM CrimeData
WHERE Precipitation > 0
GROUP BY CrmCdDesc
ORDER BY CrimeCount DESC;
```

#### Average Temperature and Crime Count
```sql
SELECT CrmCdDesc, AVG(Temperature) AS AvgTemp, COUNT(*) AS CrimeCount
FROM CrimeData
GROUP BY CrmCdDesc
ORDER BY AvgTemp DESC;
```

### 2.4. Victim Demographics

#### Crimes by Victim Age Group
```sql
SELECT CASE 
          WHEN VictAge < 18 THEN 'Under 18'
          WHEN VictAge BETWEEN 18 AND 35 THEN '18-35'
          WHEN VictAge BETWEEN 36 AND 60 THEN '36-60'
          ELSE 'Above 60'
       END AS AgeGroup, COUNT(*) AS CrimeCount
FROM CrimeData
GROUP BY AgeGroup
ORDER BY AgeGroup;
```

## Step 3: Visualise SQL Results

Once you generate query results, you can visualise them using Python:

```python
import pandas as pd
import mysql.connector
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Connect to MySQL
conn = mysql.connector.connect(
    host="localhost",
    user="your_username",
    password="your_password",
    database="CrimeDataDB"
)

# Query the data
query = "SELECT HOUR(TimeOcc) AS Hour, COUNT(*) AS CrimeCount FROM CrimeData GROUP BY Hour ORDER BY Hour;"
df = pd.read_sql(query, conn)

# Plot the results
plt.figure(figsize=(10, 6))
plt.bar(df['Hour'], df['CrimeCount'], color='blue')
plt.title('Crimes by Hour')
plt.xlabel('Hour of Day')
plt.ylabel('Crime Count')
plt.show()
```

## Step 4: Identify Relationships

### 4.1. Correlation Analysis
Check for relationships between numerical data, e.g., weather and crime counts:
```sql
SELECT Temperature, Humidity, COUNT(*) AS CrimeCount
FROM CrimeData
GROUP BY Temperature, Humidity
ORDER BY CrimeCount DESC;
```

### 4.2. Heatmaps
Export aggregated data to Python for heatmap visualisation:

```python
import seaborn as sns

# Query for heatmap data
query = "SELECT AreaName, MONTH(DateOcc) AS Month, COUNT(*) AS CrimeCount FROM CrimeData GROUP BY AreaName, Month;"
df = pd.read_sql(query, conn)

# Pivot the data
pivot_df = df.pivot(index='AreaName', columns='Month', values='CrimeCount')

# Plot the heatmap
plt.figure(figsize=(12, 8))
sns.heatmap(pivot_df, annot=True, fmt="d", cmap="YlGnBu")
plt.title("Crimes by Area and Month")
plt.show()
```

## Step 5: Advanced Analysis

### 5.1. Clustering Areas
Use clustering to identify areas with similar crime patterns:

#### Query aggregated crime counts per area:
```sql
SELECT AreaName, COUNT(*) AS CrimeCount, AVG(Temperature) AS AvgTemp, AVG(Humidity) AS AvgHumidity
FROM CrimeData
GROUP BY AreaName;
```

#### Apply clustering in Python:
```python
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans

# Load the data
area_data = pd.read_sql(query, conn)
kmeans = KMeans(n_clusters=3)
area_data['Cluster'] = kmeans.fit_predict(area_data[['CrimeCount', 'AvgTemp', 'AvgHumidity']])

# Visualise clusters
sns.scatterplot(data=area_data, x='CrimeCount', y='AvgTemp', hue='Cluster', palette='Set2')
```

### 5.2. Predictive Analysis
Using features like time, area, and weather, predict the likelihood of specific crimes:

#### Query features and labels:
```sql
SELECT HOUR(TimeOcc) AS Hour, Area, Temperature, Humidity, CrmCdDesc
FROM CrimeData;
```

#### Apply machine learning models (e.g., decision trees or random forests) in Python to classify crime types or predict crime-prone areas.

## Step 6: Report and Document Insights

Prepare visualisations and summary statistics. Highlight:
- Temporal crime patterns (e.g., peak hours/days).
- Weather-crime relationships (e.g., increase in crimes on hot days).
- Area-specific insights (e.g., hotspots for particular crimes).

Create a comprehensive project report showcasing these findings.
