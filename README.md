  The Crime Data Analysis of NAPD.
</h1>

## 🧩 Introduction:
<d align="Justify">

This project aims to explore and analyse crime patterns in Los Angeles using a dataset spanning from 2020 to the present. The primary focus is to extract meaningful insights by integrating structured data analysis and advanced techniques in SQL and Natural Language Processing (NLP). Weather data is merged with crime records to study the relationship between climatic conditions and criminal activities. SQL is utilised for efficient querying and pattern identification, while NLP is applied to crime descriptions to uncover trends, classify incidents, and perform sentiment analysis. This comprehensive analysis will help understand temporal, spatial, and contextual crime patterns, providing valuable insights into crime dynamics in the city. The project not only demonstrates technical expertise in SQL, MySQL, and Python but also showcases the ability to integrate AI-driven tools for actionable data insights, making it an impactful contribution to public safety research and career aspirations in the AI/ML domain.
